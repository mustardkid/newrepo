# AI Video Processing Pipeline for RideReels

## Overview

This document outlines the AI-powered video processing pipeline that will transform raw UTV/ATV footage into viral-ready highlight reels for publishing on platforms like YouTube and TikTok.

## Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Content Ingestion
- Raw footage upload via web interface
- Metadata collection (location, rider info, equipment, date)
- Initial quality assessment
- Storage in cloud-based content library

### 2. AI Analysis & Segmentation
- Frame extraction for computer vision analysis
- Motion detection to identify high-action segments
- Scene classification (jumps, drifts, terrain challenges, crashes, etc.)
- Quality scoring of segments (stability, lighting, framing)
- Audio analysis for excitement cues (engine sounds, reactions)
- Metadata generation (tags, descriptions, categories)

### 3. Highlight Selection
- Scoring algorithm to rank segments by excitement/quality
- Diversity filter to ensure variety in final compilation
- Duration optimization based on target platform
- Smart selection of complementary clips

### 4. Compilation & Editing
- Automatic assembly of selected highlights
- Transition generation based on content
- Intro/outro creation with RideReels branding
- Music selection and synchronization
- Text overlay generation (location, rider credits)
- Speed adjustments for dramatic effect

### 5. Platform Optimization
- Format adaptation for each target platform (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram)
- Aspect ratio conversion (16:9, 9:16, 1:1)
- Thumbnail generation with engagement optimization
- Description and tag optimization for SEO
- Publishing schedule recommendation

### 6. Performance Tracking
- View/engagement monitoring across platforms
- Creator attribution tracking
- Revenue allocation calculation
- Performance analytics for creators and partners

## Creator Attribution System

The core of our revenue sharing model:

1. **Clip Identification**
   - Each uploaded clip assigned unique identifier
   - Maintain source metadata throughout processing

2. **Usage Tracking**
   - Record which clips appear in published content
   - Track duration and prominence in final videos

3. **Revenue Attribution**
   - Monitor revenue from each published video
   - Calculate creator shares based on:
     - Clip duration in final video
     - Prominence (featured vs. background)
     - Quality and excitement score
     - Creator tier/history

4. **Payment Processing**
   - Automated calculations via Stripe
   - Monthly payout processing
   - Transparent reporting to creators
